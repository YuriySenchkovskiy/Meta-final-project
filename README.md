<h1> Little Lemon  </h1>

Little Lemon is owned by Giuseppe and Isabella, 
a husband-and-wife duo who relocated from Italy 
in their youth. Always dreaming of sharing their 
family recipes, they've turned their passion into 
reality, bringing a taste of their heritage to 
your dining experience. Giuseppe draws inspiration 
from family recipes and his culinary experience 
in Italy to craft our menu, while Isabella handles 
all the marketing efforts for the restaurant. 
Together, Giuseppe and Isabella have expanded 
the menu beyond traditional Italian, incorporating 
a diverse array of flavors from the broader 
Mediterranean region.
